There are many different priorities at Turing and in life that I will have to handle all at once. Finding the right balance between all of them ,i.e time management, will be key in determining my success at Turing.

Learning how to learn is another takeaway I've had from the first couple of classes. As a complete programming beginner there are many different aspects that I will need to improve upon to be successful. So it's important that I figure out a learning method in order to best absorb & utilize this material.  

Two Strategies

I will also focus on taking short breaks more often. When I learn new material I can get obsessive and throw myself against the wall. That method is not the best as I am more likely to get burned out. Focusing on breaks and taking my time will help facilitate the learning process for me much better than in the past.

I will also work on how I view the learning process. I normally use the learning process to get to a specific end goal and I usually aim to get there as quickly as possible. Instead I believe I would benefit from taking a slower approach and trying to soak in the material as opposed to cramming to get to my end goal.
